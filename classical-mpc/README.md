# Essence of this repository
MPC is the strategy with the best feedback properties for a nonlinear system, for a system $\dot{x}=f(x,u)$ the solution is $u^\star=\arg\min\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}L_k(x,u) + V_N(x,u)$. This folder contains the simplest example borrowed from the book of Cannon (2016). Where a MPC predict some inputs (u) from $k=0,1,...,N-1$ and then LQR continues the prediction to $N...
